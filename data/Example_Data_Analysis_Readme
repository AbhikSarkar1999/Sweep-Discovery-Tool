The Example_Data_Results.xlsx file contains predicted selective sweep status of randomly choosen 15 genomic regions from the ExampleVCF.vcf file (Sample Data).

The ExampleVCF.vcf file has been utilized to Sweep Discovery Tool interface with the parameters as provided in the Example_Data_Results.xlsx file for each of 15 genomic regions.

Necessary input files which are VCF file in Gzipped format and Tabix-indexed format have been included altogether along with normal VCF file in the Example_Data.zip file as sample data.

Predictions of selective sweep status on specified chromosomal regions can be obtained through following the manual provided for Sweep Discovery Tool.
